\section{Summary}

In this chapter the angular distribution of \BdToKstll was presented.
The helicity amplitudes for $\Bd\to\Kstarzo\ellell$ and $\Bd\to\Kstarzz\ellell$ are detailed 
 showing the structure arising from a Hamiltonian written in terms of Wilson coefficients.
Several experimental observables are set out which are favoured theoretically for
 the ability to calculate predictions cleanly.
