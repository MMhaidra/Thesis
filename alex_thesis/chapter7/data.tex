\section{Selection of \BdToKpimm candidates}

\subsection{Data}
\label{sec:swave:meas:data}

The measurement of the S-wave contribution to \BdToKpimm was performed on the complete dataset collected at \lhcb in 2011.
This was the identical dataset used in the second angular analysis presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:kstmm} and 
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.0\invfb at $\sqs=7\tev$. 
The data are described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:kstmm:data}.

The simulation samples that were used in this measurement consist of the samples already described in Section~\ref{sec:kstmm:data:mc} 
along with an additional sample of \BdToKpimm events.
This additional simulation sample was generated uniformly in phase space and in the MC11 configuration
 using the \lhcb simulation as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:lhcb:soft}.
This simulation was used to understand the efficiency in the wide \kpi mass range.

The data-simulation corrections developed in Sec~\ref{sec:kstmm:data:mccorr} were applied to all of the simulation samples in order to ensure
 that the efficiency calculations were as accurate as possible.
