\section{Conclusions}

The angular analysis of \BdToKstmm  at \lhcb was performed on 
both 0.38\invfb and 1.0\invfb of data taken in 2011. 

Clean samples of \BdToKstmm candidates were selected using both a cut-based selection and a multi-variate algorithm. 
There were around 340 candidates in 0.38\invfb and 900 candidates in 1.0\invfb of data.
The first dataset is comparable to previous results from the \babar, \belle and \cdf 
and the second dataset is the largest sample of \BdToKstmm candidates at one experiment to date.

The candidates were corrected for the acceptance effect introduced by the reconstruction and selection by applying a weight to each event.
The first analysis used a $k$-nearest-neighbour method to calculate the efficiency to selected simulated events at a point in \ctl and \ctk.
This was an accurate calculation but the prevision and accuracy was limited by the number of simulated candidates in the regions of phase space with low efficiency.
The second analysis calculated the efficiency from a function fitted to each of the \ctl, \ctk and \varphi distributions independently.
This limitation of this method is that it assumes that the efficiency factorises into each dimension, which introduces additional sources of systematic uncertainty.
The method of weighting each of the \BdToKstmm candidate for their acceptance was chosen over the alternative method,
 of combining the signal model and a function for the efficiency, in order to minimise the number of free parameters in the final model. 	
This allowed measurement of the angular observables using the multi-dimensional angular distribution which fully incorporated the correlations between the angular observables.

The acceptance effect and the data-simulation corrections were the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty for both analyses. 
This is because the events with lowest efficiency, at extreme \ctl and high \ctk, have a large effect on the central value of \AFB and \FL.
This can be improved by a better understanding of the simulation and the efficiency to select \BdToKstmm candidates
 but the understanding of the efficiency in this region of phase space is a limitation on the accuracy of the measurement.

The first angular analysis obtained the worlds most precise measurements of the observables \AFB and \FL as well as measuring the differential branching fraction.
The second angular analysis improved the measurements of \AFB and \FL 
as well as measuring several new angular observables for the first time.
The measurements of \AFB and \FL from \lhcb along with the measurements from \babar, \belle and \cdf are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:res:comboexp}.

It is possible to see that the \lhcb results are the most precise and are compatible with the SM prediction.~\label{fig:res:comboexp}}

The combination of these results, along with other radiative,
semi-leptonic and purely leptonic decays has enabled stringent limits to be set on the 
values for the Wilson coefficients \C7, \C9 and \C10 along with 
a high limit on the mass scale of any particle that contributes via
electroweak penguin diagrams~\cite{Bobeth:2011nj,Altmannshofer:2011gn,Altmannshofer:2012az}.
These constraints affect any new physics model that contains high mass particles with flavour couplings, 
providing a model-independent test of the mass scale of contributions from physics beyond the standard model.
