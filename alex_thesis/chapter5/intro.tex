\section{Introduction}

The angular analyses presented in this chapter are
the first and second angular analyses of \BdToKstmm performed at \lhcb. 
The first angular analysis concentrates on measuring the values of 
\AFB, \FL and the differential branching fraction in seven bins of dimuon mass. 
This was performed on the first 0.38\invfb of  data recorded at \lhcb in 2011. 
The second angular analysis is an extension of the first to encompass the 
angular observables dependent on \varphi. This allowed the measurement of \OS3, \OS9 and \OA9
 as well as the transverse angular observables, \ATRe, \ATIm and \AT2 .
This analysis uses the complete dataset of 1.0\invfb recorded in 2011 at \lhcb. 

Both analyses followed three main steps to obtain the values of the angular observables 
and the differential branching fraction in bins of \qsq.
A cut-based selection and a multi-variate discriminant are used to select signal \BdToKstmm candidates from the data.
Subsequently, the selected \BdToKstmm candidates were corrected for the acceptance effect introduced from their reconstruction and selection.
Finally, the weighted data was simultaneously fitted with a \PDF describing the
 \Bd invariant mass distribution and the angular distribution to determine the results.

This chapter follows the structure of the analysis in a similar manner.
The data for each analysis and the simulation used in this analysis are described in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:kstmm:data}. 
The selection of the \kpimm candidates for both analyses is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:kstmm:sel}. 
The two different methods used for the acceptance correction are detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:kstmm:ac}.
The \PDF used to determine the angular observables for each analysis and the method of determining the errors
 is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:kstmm:pdf}. 
The estimates of the contribution from systematic effects are detailed in Sec~\ref{sec:kstmm:sys}. 
The results for the angular observables and for the differential branching fraction 
from both angular analyses are presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:kstmm:res}.
